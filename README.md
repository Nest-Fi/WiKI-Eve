# WiKI-Eveï¼šPassword-Stealing without Hacking: Wi-Fi Enabled Practical Keystroke Eavesdropping
WiKI-Eve is a hacking-free password eavesdropping system that uses Wi-FI Beamforming information (BFI) to steal private information, such as digital passwords, from the smartphone unlock interface.

In this repository, we publish the BFI and CSI datasets collected under different background traffic. In addition, we also open-source the sparse recovery algorithm model and the code for parsing BFI from the JSON file saved by Wireshark.
